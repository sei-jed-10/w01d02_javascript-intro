// Variables and Primitive Data Types

// The Fortune Teller
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
let numberChildren= 2;
let partnerName= "Shamshoun and Marengo";
let geographicLocation= "Boston";
let jobTitle= "Vet";
console.log (`You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, and married to ${partnerName} with ${numberChildren} Kids.`);



// The Age Calculator
// Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!
// Store the current year in a variable.
// Store their birth year in a variable.
// Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.
let currentYear= 2019;
let birthYear= 1990;
let age1= currentYear-birthYear;
let age2 = age1-1;
console.log (`They are either ${age1} or ${age2},substituting the values.`);



// The Lifetime Supply Calculator
// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable.
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".
// Bonus: Get the current year using JavaScript!
let currentAge=29;
let maximumAge= 70;
let amountPerday= 3;
let total= (maximumAge-currentAge)* (366 *amountPerday);
console.log (`You will need ${total} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maximumAge}`);



// The Geometrizer
// Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.
// Store a radius into a variable.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

let radius= 20;
let circumference= (2*radius)*3.14;
console.log( `The circumference is ${circumference}`);
let area= (radius*radius)*3.14;
console.log(`The area is ${area}`);


// The Temperature Converter
// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.
// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."
var celsiusTemp = 3;
var fahrenheitTemp = 5;

var convertedCelsius = (fahrenheitTemp -32 ) * ( 5/9);
var convertedFahrenheit = celsiusTemp * (9/5) + 32;

console.log(celsiusTemp+"°C is "+convertedFahrenheit+"°F.");
console.log(fahrenheitTemp+"°F is "+convertedCelsius+"°C.")
